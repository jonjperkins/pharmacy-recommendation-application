This ongoing project provides a means for pharmacy clinic volunteers to input
non-HIPPA information about interactions with patients into a database hosted 
on heroku. 

The goal of the application is to create a straightforward and quick way for
students to input the data, and to allow for administrators to export the database
to a .cvs file for statistical analysis. 

Currently, the user model is not in use, but will likely be implemented as a means
to protect access to the survey/index page which houses the link to download the
database to a .csv file.
